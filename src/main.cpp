 * ESP8266 Hydroponic Automation Sensor Module
 * 
 * Author: Varad Chaskar
 * Date: January 28, 2024
 * 
 * Description: 
 * This code is part of a hydroponic automation project using an ESP8266 microcontroller. 
 * It collects environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and water level,
 * and sends the data to the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform for real-time monitoring and analysis.
 * 
 * Libraries Used:
 * 1. WiFiManager: Simplifies WiFi connection handling. It helps automatically connect the ESP8266
 *    to a known WiFi network or starts an access point (AP) for manual configuration if no known network is available.
 *    - Required for establishing a WiFi connection without hardcoding network credentials.
 * 
 * 2. ESP8266WiFi: Provides WiFi functionality for ESP8266. 
 *    - Used for establishing a WiFi connection and sending/receiving data.
 * 
 * 3. DHT: DHT sensor library used for interfacing with a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor.
 *    - Used to measure temperature and humidity.
 * 
 * 4. ThingSpeak: A library that provides seamless communication with the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform.
 *    - Sends the environmental sensor data (temperature, humidity, light intensity, and water level) to ThingSpeak.
 * 
 * Functionality:
 * 1. Connects to WiFi using WiFiManager.
 * 2. Reads sensor data (temperature, humidity from the DHT sensor, light intensity from an LDR, and water level).
 * 3. Sends the sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud for monitoring.
